				<h3>Timelines</h3><br>
				<p><b>Week 1</b> – Prototype 1 complete, develop presentation</p>
<p><b>Week 2</b> – Begin development of business plan, Proposal of minimum of 30% of profits from commercial units go towards bushfire/firefighting charities. Further development of presentation.</p>
<p><b>Week 3</b> – Procurement of alternate parts to build v2 Prototype, Further development of presentation. </p>
<p><b>Week 4</b> – Research on operating systems (OS). Decided that it is too unstable to run an android app through an android emulator running on a Debian OS. Lineage OS utilised instead as it has far less complications and can easily download apps using a skeletonised version of Google Play specifically for Lineage. Further development of presentation.</p>
<p><b>Week 5</b> – Commencement of V2 build, SD flashed with Lineage OS, apps downloaded. Output powered speaker modified to fit better within new enclosure. Camera installed. Further development of presentation.</p>
<p><b>Week 6</b> – Prototype V2 complete, presentation complete.</p>
<p><b>Week 7</b> – Investigate portable compact packaging and power options, User value proposition research to ensure our solution aligns with real life user needs. Also, research and begin procurement of alternate sources and types of construction materials/methods and components; particularly glass reinforced, injection moulded plastic enclosures, various types and thickness rubber outer sleeves, insulation and methods of shock proofing (if found more suitable – price, quality, lead time, ethics of vendor company etc being important factors). Outsource coding of an integrated SSTV encoder/decoder app to run on Lineage OS with encryption.</p>
<p><b>Week 8</b> – Continued – Investigate portable compact packaging and power options, User value proposition research to ensure our solution aligns with real life user needs. Also, research and begin procurement of alternate sources and types of construction materials/methods and components; particularly glass reinforced, injection moulded plastic enclosures, various types and thickness rubber outer sleeves, insulation and methods of shock proofing, (if found more suitable – price, quality, lead time, ethics of vendor company etc being important factors). Outsource coding of an integrated SSTV encoder/decoder app to run on Lineage OS with encryption. </p>
<p><b>Week 9</b> – 3D printing of portable casing and testing, User concept testing research to ensure our solution aligns with real life user needs. Initial development of optimal temperature management configuration (Insulation, fans, heatsinks).</p>
<p><b>Week 10</b> – Drop testing of Dummy cases and rubber outer housing to find most suitable type. </p>
<p><b>Week 11</b> – Testing of newly coded, integrated SSTV encoder/decoder application. If satisfied, app will be installed in units in enclosures and drop tested again, further shock proofing developed and installed if necessary.</p>
<p><b>Week 12</b> - Insulation installed in units.  Units heat stress tested in temperature-controlled environment to obtain average maximum possible ambient operating temperature. </p>
<p><b>Week 13</b> – Field testing of commercial prototype, Gather first field tester feedback. (Note: If there is a delay in supply of materials for enclosure, insulation etc, the scope of these tests may be reduced).</p>
<p><b>Week 14</b> – Finalise commercial prototype and prepare presentation for further funding.</p>
<p><b>Week 15</b> – Deliver commercial prototype for approval for funding to extensively test and develop.</p>

      <h3>Risks</h3><br>
      <p>These are some of the major risks we have identified:</p>
  <ul.style3><p>
    <li>Specific components of hardware or apps chosen do not perform as expected and need to be replaced – mitigated by early testing and market research for alternatives.</li><br>

<li>Technology is too complex for emergency workers (mostly volunteers) and citizens to learn and remember, particularly under stressful conditions. Mitigation – strong UX/UI work to ensure that end product will be more instinctive and contextual help built into system for reference in real time operations.</li><br>

<li>Enclosure for system and external components (microphone, camera, touchscreen, speaker) not being appropriately cooled (number and placement of heat sinks, fans). Mitigation – Heat stress testing in temperature-controlled environment to find maximum temperature unit can operate at. This will be coupled with experimentation to find the optimal temperature management. This heat testing would become part of the Quality Control processes in future commercial units.</li><br>

<li>Enclosure and external components not having enough insulation to operate in intense bushfire conditions. Mitigation - Heat stress testing in a temperature-controlled environment with varying types, placement and amounts of insulation placed in different units to find which is most effective. As mentioned above this heat stressing will eventually evolve into a crucial Quality Control process for each commercial unit produced.</li><br>

<li>Enclosure for system being too fragile (cracking/breaking when used whilst operating. Mitigation - Drop testing. Enclosures with dummy internals will be dropped from different heights on different surfaces.  These test enclosures will be of varying types of plastic and percentage of glass fibre reinforcement. These will be coupled with a rubber outer layer for grip/shock absorption, these rubber outers will also be of varying thickness.</li><br>

 <li>Enclosure not providing enough physical shock protection. Mitigation – Drop testing. Once optimal insulation, type of plastic, percentage, and preferred type of rubber outer is found.  Internal shock-proofing may be integrated into live units with varying thicknesses of Rubber Outer to find which is most effective and ergonomic. </li><br>
    </ul.style3></P>

<p>Both James and Chris have previous experience in Raspberry Pi’s, so imaging the SD cards with Lineage-OS won’t be as difficult as first expected. Most of our team members have experience in the Android OS in some form or another, either in tablet, phone, Raspberry PI or media center. Consequently, downloading and installing the two required apps, Robot36 and SSTV Encoder, won’t pose any issues.</p>

<h3>Group processes and communications</h3><br>
    <p> The team work well together however diverse skillsets and external time pressures have made meetings and collaboration difficult. The project started badly as team members were disheartened by low marks in the previous project despite considerable effort.  At least two our team members faced unavoidable work/life issues during the latest project, including our technical expert on this project. We chose a very technical project because we all hoped it would be a significant learning experience, and it received the most enthusiasm from the marker previously (and we needed better marks). This was an unfortunate decision as the rest of the team did not have all the technical knowledge about the project we needed and could not acquire it.   </p>
