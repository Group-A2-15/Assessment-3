				<p><b><a href="https://annalee5.github.io/Assignment1/" target=blank>Anna Lee</b></a><img src="images/Anna.jpg" style="float:right;"> - I am Melbourne born and bred, but I am of Chinese heritage. Before Covid stopped the world, I was a Marketing Manager for a hospitality group, of which I really loved doing because of my passion for food and wine. With plenty of unforeseen spare time up my sleeve due to the pandemic, I have been keeping myself busy reading (definitely want to learn more about Cosmology in particular), knitting (currently attempting a sweater), going for bike rides (damn you steep inclines!) and learning the basics of HTML/CSS. After having some time on my hands this year, I started learning HTML/CSS basics and really found myself enjoying it. This sparked an idea to take my learning to a more formal setting, which is how I got into this course. I’m very excited to see what potential this can bring, both personally and professionally!

				<p><b><a href="https://christopher-grant.github.io/IIT/" target=blank>Christopher Grant</b></a><img src="images/Chris.jpg" style="float:left;"> -  I am a 38-year-old male born in Melbourne, Australia. I left high school after Year 10 to work full time in the retail industry. I have a cert. II in Retail Operations and have completed a few introductory short courses in programming including Python & SQL. I am currently an Operations Manager in a printing & point of sale company in Melbourne’s SE. In my spare time, I like to get outside and go for a hike, snowboard or even just take my dogs for a walk. The interest I have in IT comes from my childhood, specifically my father. For many years my father would show me the basics of tinkering with electronics, how to read wiring diagrams, and we would often design, create and build small projects using components like 555 timers, etc. During my studies at RMIT, I expect to learn how to undertake tasks like web design, data management and analyses, software development and cloud computing to help further my career.

				<p><b><a href="https://jagreig333.github.io/JamesProjects/" target=blank>James Greig</b></a><img src="images/james.jpg" style="float:right;"> - I was born in New Zealand, now living in Perth, WA. I was previously studying Bachelor of Applied Sciences at RMIT and am looking at transferring to Bachelor of IT, so I am doing two units this semester to test the waters. So far I am very much enjoying it. My interests are varied – permaculture, brewing/distilling, philosophy, guitar, martial arts.  I live with my beautiful partner, my stepdaughter, our dog, 3 cats, and 2 pink and grey galahs.
					My particular interests in IT are Programming and Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is probably the greatest of these interests. I chose RMIT because it has a good reputation for IT, and also it was the best option available via Open Universities Australia. I expect to learn through this degree (and probably Graduate Certificates/Masters ) a skill set that will give me access to work in the IT industry, working in Cyber Security.

<p><b><a href="https://nietcat.github.io/RMITIntro/" target=blank>Michelle May</b></a><img src="images/michelle.jpg" style="float:left;"> - I am a proud Australian Aboriginal woman. I have a Diploma of Project Management and have studied linguistics and philosophy. I have worked primarily in the digital space beginning with website and intranet management. I have moved onto working with businesses in projects and change management roles to identify and bring to life digital opportunities. I usually act as the intermediary between IT and the business. My interest in IT resonates with making services, especially government, easier, cheaper and better for ordinary people. I believe technology benefits should be available to everyone. I have a special interest in human centred design and the Digital Service Standard. I chose RMIT as it has a strong reputation as a university for Information Technology studies, studying through OUA for flexibility. I expect my studies to lead to a better understanding of different specialist roles and services to communicate and use them better to build valuable and robust services. Student ID: s3879582</p>

	<p><b><a href="https://rebeccadaimol.github.io/IIT/" target=blank>Rebecca Daimol</b></a><img src="images/rebecca.jpg" style="float:right;"> - I am a Papua New Guinean living in South Australia with my partner and children. I speak English and New Guinea Pidgin but also understand the language native to my Mother’s island home; PNG itself has over 850 different languages. I grew up and eventually worked on Lihir Island, which is 3 degrees south of the equator. Lihir hosts a gold mining operation in a dormant volcano and operations face the challenge of working with geothermal activity. My decision to pursue IT was influenced by my experience during the peak of COVID19 in cases in South Australia in April 2020. I home-schooled my children for a month and realised that even my primary school-aged children have a dependency on IT. This sparked my interest in the industry and prompted me to consider their security. Through this degree pathway, I expect to develop the theoretical knowledge and practical experience necessary to begin a career in the IT industry. I look forward to the insights into Information Technology that make it the ever-evolving phenomena that it is. There is also an emphasis on communications and social interactions, that reminds us of the human component, I believe this will prepare me for the professional environment. Student ID: s3875198</p>

	<p><b><a href="https://shevlyn.github.io/MY-PROFILE-A1/personalinformation.html" target=blank>Shevlyn Maharaj</b></a><img src="images/shevlyn.jpg" style="float:left;"> - I am a Fijian Indian. I have completed Year 10, currently halfway through year 11 but I have enrolled in University. An interesting fact is that I do MMA, Muay This and Boxing. I also have a 1 year old German Shepherd. Growing up in this day and age, I have been exposed to information technology on a daily basis in some way, which lead me to solve virtual technology related problems in my surroundings and therefore always having interest in IT. Although, I have not yet decided on a specific desired job, working alongside government agencies as well as having other IT jobs definitely interests me. Student ID: s3871451</p>

          <h2>Group Processes</h2>
          <span class="byline">How did we find working together & what can we implemement for Assignment three?</span>
        </div>
        <p>As our group of 6 was formed for assignment 2, we had to formulate a plan to communicate with each other regularly to work on our project. Justified with different lifestyles, we managed to effectively find time that would be suitable to everyone and conducted our group meetings. Sometimes all members could not be present at the meetings, but we took initiative to watch the recordings as everyone is mutually accountable for the development of the assessment. From forming the group, we quickly evolved to working on our delegated tasks with frequent check-ups, mutual support and critically criticizing to enhance and produce our best work. Overall, our group did quite well in assignment 2, but there is always room for improvement, and we are hoping to introduce slight changes in assignment 3, in terms of better effective communication and time management. It is essential to assign a certain date before the due date to complete our contributions, to check everyone's work and then submit. our group did quite well in this section as we sent all our completed parts to the rest of the group for feedback. In assignment 3, we will have much better communication and know where everyone’s at. we have set out our task breakdown which is extremely helpful for the process supported by spontaneous group meetings if needed. As we received criticism for sparkplus and GitHub contribution, we also aim to present change for effective improvement in that area too for assignment 3.</p>

            <h2>Career Plans</h2><br>
            <span class="byline">Comparing and contrasting our career plans</span>
          </div>
            <p>Studying Information Technology means that you are surrounded by several roles and job opportunities. Our group of 6 is a clear example of this, showcasing different interests in this industry, initially influenced by IT. As we all wish to pursue different career paths, although being in the same field.<br></P>
              <p><b>James and Rebecca's</b> ideal job are a reflection of this, as they are both extremely passionate about cyber security, however their specific roles require different responsibilities and skills, this is due to the many aspects of cyber security which differentiate their desired position. Although, they both will be working around cyber security, their roles have contrasting designated tasks. James as a cyber security consultant will be responsible to oversee projects, asses any risks, to ensure that mandatory requirements are met. Additionally, providing guidance to teams and consulting clients. In comparison to Rebecca who will be involved in all stages of the software development process, although they both will be collaboratively working in teams on cyber security, their roles have many differences. <br>
              <b>Michelle's</b> ideal job position as the Senior Technology Change and Adoption Manager, is also very similar to James’ role as it is an internal consulting style position, hence, requires leadership skills and the ability to recognize and make changes of strategies for success.<br>
               <b>Christopher's</b> ideal job is to be a chief technology/information officer whose role will be to develop and implement IT strategies to lead the IT functions of the business hence, a role that will cover all aspects of IT across different businesses.<br>
               <b>Shevlyn's</b> ideal job is also to be a digital information officer, which sounds very similar to Christophers preferred position yet, very different. This position works alongside a secret intelligence collection agency with its core responsibility collect and protect digital records and intelligence related information. This role does require managing and collating data like some other roles; however, it has a very different objective.<br>
                <b>Anna’s</b> ideal role is a product designer for ABC Kids, a position that is focused on both UI and UX. A very focused position that allows you to also bring your fun and creative side. Overall, all our Ideal jobs revolve around IT, working collaboratively, requires strong communication skills but, also demonstrate how on subject can open so many opportunities.</p>
