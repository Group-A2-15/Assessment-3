					<h2>Project Idea</h2>
					<span class="byline">Raspberry Pi based Integrated SSTV Encoder/Decoder, with End to End Encryption.</span>
				</div>
				<h3>Overview</h3><br>
				<p>The objective of this project is to recreate an encoder/decoder for images and video sent by Slow Scan Television (SSTV). SSTV is a way to transmit and receive an image or series of images or video using low frequency radio transmissions. Standard analogue television requires a bandwidth of 8MHz wide channels; however, SSTV only requires a bandwidth of 3Khz. (Wikipedia, 2020). With Slow Scan Television, the information for the image or series of images is encoded into a tone, which is transmitted and when received and decoded it is reverted to the original image. (Wikipedia, 2020)
SSTV is predominantly used by ham radio enthusiasts, however this technology has much wider potential applications for more effective communications systems - especially for emergency services, first responder or remote workers. </p>
<p>Our chosen target audience is emergency workers in the case of natural disaster. The project will begin by building a proof of concept using a Raspberry pi 3 or 4 board, an integrated touch screen housing, ganged 18650 battery removable power supplies, a USB microphone, and a miniature speaker connected by the 3.5mm output jack present on the Raspberry Pi board. This initial proof of concept will run an android emulator, running android based apps.
We aim to build on new and existing technologies to deliver an easy to use, portable communication device, specifically aimed at emergency service personal use in the unfortunate event of a natural disaster.</P>

</h5></i>
      <h3>Motivation</h3><br>
      <p>The motivation behind this project is to create an extremely useful, and potentially lifesaving, piece of technology on a relatively simple execution and low-cost budget.</p>

<p>Over the past 12 months, it has been devastatingly evident how catastrophic the effect of bushfire is, both on a local and a global scale. Increasingly bushfire seasons are starting earlier, and the scale and intensity of them is reaching unprecedented levels. “The extensive and long-lived fires appear to be the largest in scale in the modern record in New South Wales, while the total area burnt appears to be the largest in a single recorded fire season for eastern Australia” (BOM, 2019).</p>

<p>ITU states that “in the initial hours in the aftermath of a disaster, people want to be informed so that they understand what is happening and assess how they, their families and friends can receive support. Most recently, radio has played a key role in the Australian Bushfire response, helping responders to keep local populations up-to-date and coordinate and execute evacuation plans“ (ITU, 2020, para 5-6). If infrastructure is destroyed or signal quality is reduced to a significant level by fire effects, any messages sent through mobile networks or standard broadcast radio networks are rendered useless.</p>

<p>With statistics like these, it is increasingly evident of how vital this technology is to develop. Bushfires are no longer isolated to small rural areas of low populations. DUring the 2019-2020 bushfire season, evacuations were required in the Melbourne suburbs of Bundoora, Greensborough and Mill Park, 20 kilometres from the CBD, as an out-of-control blaze crept dangerously close (ABC, 2019).</p>

<p>This project could be used in natural disasters, for Paramedics working in remote locations, for First Responders at mine sites or even for the Royal Flying Doctors. Images and video could be sent and received where normal communications have stopped functioning, have severely degraded signal, or have insufficient infrastructure in the area to operate. THe project could also provide doctors with a way to give consultations to those living far from any regional centre and to send images between Doctor and patient. </p>

<p>This project could also be used for agricultural projects in remote areas without infrastructure for digital mobile phone service, or even in the developing world - giving the opportunity to send images and data from point to point.</p>

<h3>Landscape</h3><br>
<p>Our research shows that there is little currently available that is similar to our imaging communication tool. UHF/VHF frequency radio has traditionally been used by Emergency Services, however this technology only transmits audio. We have considered whether a user could run two existing mobile apps on their phone - one to encode images and sending sound bites (SSTV encoder) and the other to receive sound bites and decode them to images (Robot36) - however in the event of extreme heat, such as a bushfire, the heat would dramatically affect the performance of the phone, potentially rendering it useless.

Whilst there are many audio communication devices in the market that are currently used by Emergency services, none are quite like ours. We use the combined practicalities of SSTV and UHF/VHF radio to enable our device to transmit both audio and visual elements over low frequencies. </p>

      <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3><br>
      <p>The tools and tech that are required to begin our project vary from locally sourced hardware to specific custom-made apps in future state. To begin, this section will start to run through the required items to get this project underway. At the core of the project we will be running on two 8GiB RAM Raspberry Pi 4s. The Raspberry Pi is a very versatile, customizable small single-board computer capable running many program language interrupters usually on a Debian-based (32-bit) Linux distribution OS. With a Broadcom BCM2711B0 1.5 GHz quad-core A72 64-bit processor and 8 GiB LPDDR4-3200 SDRAM at the heart of the Raspberry Pi, this will make encoding images and decoding sound bites possible in a fast and efficient manner. Along with the Raspberry Pi, we will also need the appropriate peripherals like, mouse, keyboard, SD card, speaker and USB microphone. At some point in the future state development we can move to touchscreen for greater portability. We have chosen to run with an Android based OS called LineageOS 16.0 (Android 9) because all the necessary drivers are all bundled and included in this distro. This freeware OS is released by Konstakang and is available <a href="https://konstakang.com/devices/rpi4/LineageOS16.0/" target = blank>here</a>. The Android platform has many pre-existing repositories (app stores) available to users with a variety of apps and resources. For our project we have decided to run 2 apps called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xdsopl.robot36>" target=blank>Robot36</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=om.sstvencoder&hl=en&gl=US" target=blank>SSTV Encoder</a>. One is primarily for encoding images and sending sound bites using SSTV encoder the other for receiving sound bites and decoding them to images using Robot36.</p>
      <p>This brings us to the transmission of the data. For data transmission between the 2 RPI’s (Raspberry Pi’s) we will be using 2x Baofeng UV-5R ham radios. A ham radio is a type of amateur radio that uses the radio frequency spectrum for non-commercial exchanges of messages, in our case images sound bites. The frequency range available in these handheld units are UHF (136 - 174MHz) & UHF (400 - 520MHz) for transmitting and VHF (136 - 174MHz), UHF (400 - 520MHz) & FM Broadcast (68-108MHz) for receiving. On the sending unit, linking the RPI to the ham radios we’ll be using the built-in audio-out jack on the RPI and the mic input on the ham radio. A standard 3.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable will work just fine for this. Just to note, when sending the sound bite to the ham radio from the RPI, the PPT (push to talk) button will need to be held down during the duration of the sending message (may be modified in future state). On the receiving unit, we will be utilizing the speaker-out on the ham radio to plug in a portable audio speaker and for the RPI we’ll be using a USB mic to feed the sound bite in. While this speaker-out and mic-in is prone to interference we will be looking at USB sound cards that can driven by the Android OS.</p>

      </h5></i>
      <h3>Skills</h3><br>
      <p>Skills for this project will be ever increasing and changing as component ideas manipulate and unfold to include more features. To begin, required skills will be:  <br>
        <ul.style3>
          <li>Flashing a USB with LineageOS from Win or OSX.</li> 
          <li>Basic understanding of Android OS and installing apps.  </li> 
            <li>Very basic understanding of computer peripherals.</li>  
            <li>Apply for Amateur non-assigned Foundation licence. </li> 
            <li>Understanding of the use between 2 ham radios.</li>  
            <li>Basic usage of a Raspberry Pi.  </li> 
          </ul.style3></p>
          <p>Future state ideas like broadcast encryption, platform migration and a stand-alone app will require further education and a greater skillset to rollout. Skills like: <br>
            <ul.style3>
              <li>Concept of OOP (Object Oriented Programing) for security. </li> 
    <li>Multi-platform architecture knowledge.  </li> 
    <li>A Programming Languages such as C#, Java, PHP or Python.  </li> 
    <li>Project management if outsourcing.  </li> 
    </ul.style3></p>
    <p>Again, as this project develops and grows in complexity, the above skills will be expanded upon and be required as new modules and features are added. Integrating to other platforms like Linux, Windows and MAC OSX could grow the potential for integration into other communication apps.</p>

<h3>Outcomes</h3><br>
    <p>The main outcome for our project is to create an imaging communication tool using a combination of new and older technologies. As a team project, some of the possible problems this may solve we’re hoping will be in the emergency service space. Looking at vulnerabilities with current communications during natural disasters lead to this project idea. Some of the communication issues facing emergency services today are failure of the wired telephone system (including internet), overload of the cell/mobile network, plasma interference from bushfires and incompatible radio systems. To start with, we’re setting this up to run off the VHF bandwidth because there are repeater stations Australia wide. However, changing the ham radios from the VHF range to an even lower bandwidth radio in the KHz range may increase communication distance & quality while providing additional support on the front line of disaster relief by emergency controllers at a safer distance.</P>
