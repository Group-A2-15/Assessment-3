					<h2>Group Reflection</h2>
				<p>GROUP 15 did not change its team structure moving into this project and we continued to work well together and managed to achieve the focus of this assignment. Upon reflection, we had a good group dynamic and considering our different circumstances as well as the distance and time differences, we managed as best we could to move forward with this assignment. Each team member contributed to the best of their ability to deliver this IT Project report.</p>

<p>Christopher exhibited his technical knowledge in the project idea development stages and was been a valuable contributor to the project planning stages when most of our members struggled to grasp the concept. His experience in Operations Management is evident in the way he conducts himself in meetings and his work ethics, often quietly achieving his allocated tasks. </p>

<p>James has been the passionate driving force and mastermind behind our project idea, introducing us all to a concept we are proud to be a part of. While we assumed, we were merely developing a theoretical project, he achieved a prototype. We hope that moving forward with this concept, James realises and achieves his potential in this industry.</p>

<p>Anna is a patient and quiet achiever. While she claims to have little technical knowledge, she has shown her skills in the designing of our team website and often her keen eye for detail has been valuable when it comes to consolidating and reviewing our work. She has potential to succeed in the UI / UX facet of IT. </p>

<p>Shevlyn was our youngest group member and despite being quiet, she has contributed quality work. Moving into this project we offered her more responsibility hoping to build her confidence and realise her potential. She stepped up to the task and we hope that this experience helps her in the future.</p>

<p>Michelle brought to the group a wealth of personal and professional IT experience and we appreciate her reflections of these aspects. She constantly instilled confidence in our team that we often needed and while she admits to a lack of understanding towards the project idea, her professionalism and ability to create a realistic project plan was indicative of her skill and expertise.</p>

<p>Rebecca was the shining light of our group, her immaculate organisation and planning skills kept us all on track, especially when she could see the group starting to lose focus during it. Her creativity and illustration skills at bringing our presentation to life must be commended!</p>

      <h3>Individual reflections</h3><br>
      <p><b>Rebeccca</b> - We continued to embrace everyone’s professional backgrounds and personal interests through this project. Having worked together for the past few months, we have developed a group dynamic that is supportive and dedicated to the goals set. It has been reassuring to discuss assignment issues with a group and an unexpected confidence boost to receive praise when I tried. Progressing through this assignment has been a challenge as personal circumstances changed, and it proved difficult to apply flexibility in terms of meetings and consolidating our work as a group. We emailed regularly, but our use of MS Teams was predominantly for file storage. Despite this, it proved beneficial to have discussed a thorough assignment breakdown and allocation sheet at the beginning to keep everyone on track. This assignment has been a huge learning experience, and I appreciate the input of each group member. It has been great meeting and getting to know each person.</p>

<p><b>Chris</b> - On reflection on assignment 3, everything seemed to flow a bit more smoothly in regarding GitHub, MS Teams and email. Communication was better than Assignment 2, due to the better knowledge and experience of these 3 platforms. The 6 of us worked well as a team and had a good bond from the knowledge of how much effort everyone contributed in A2. With everyone having external pressures like work, school, etc., meetings we’re only set once or twice a week (after we had gone through and assigned tasks) as a catch up if anyone needed extra help.<br>
The content on the other hand felt a bit more full-on. Developing, planning and start executing this project from scratch for a commercial rollout was a challenge. keeping our project in scope and limiting implementation of future state features was essential for keeping to the 15-week schedule plan.<br>
Overall, working in a group environment has shown there are always different ways to handle/tackle any issues that arise. It is surprising how simple a solution may be by getting another team member to look from another angle.
A huge thank you to James, Anna, Michelle, Rebecca and Shevlyn for being fantastic team members and wishing you the all the best! </p>

<p><b>Anna</b> - After feeling a sense of great achievement at the end of our first assignment together as a group, it was a bit disheartening to see how low our grade was for the work produced. I think this impacted the mentality of some group members, including myself, who felt we submitted a higher quality grade of work. This assignment wasn’t without its challenges, after dedicating two evenings of the week for majority of the semester, I could see the drain this requirement had on our group. We weren’t as focused during meetings, which resulted in meetings taking longer than usual. Despite this, I felt we still produced a great body work for Assignment three and five, and I attribute that to our group’s diverse skillset. In particular, Rebecca’s encouragement, enthusiasm and organisation kept the assignment on track and I felt she needed a mention for maintaining the energy within us all. This assignment has certainly taught me a few lessons in working collaboratively within a group, and it is definitely for the better.</p>

<p><b>Shevlyn</b> - Our overall group performance in this task went quite well. Its great seeing our group express constant enthusiasm for the discussion topics and do particularly well in breaking down the tasks and assigning each member with different responsibilities. As every member decided to participate and take initiative in completing tasks, we made constant progress.

There is not much I could say about improvement however, we maybe could have had better time management. It does become hard to collaborate with people with different lifestyles, in different places and timings, but we still managed to complete the assignment on time.

An integral part was to have all our contributions and documents in one place which a selected member of the group would put together. Microsoft teams was such a helpful tool in this matter, to document all our files and see progress of the group.

Overall, A great learning process as everyone has different strengths and things that they are more knowledgeable about but with the cooperation of everyone in the group, it reflects that working in groups help build social skills and allows interaction between different personalities. </p>

<p><b>Michelle</b> - The team work well together but diverse skillsets and external time pressures made meetings and collaboration on some aspects of the project difficult. The project started with team members disheartened by the low marks in the previous project despite considerable effort.  It is incredibly hard to find times that six-working people in different states can meet twice each week, and people are frequently tired and under stress at these times. Recordings of meetings help, as do lecture and tutorial recordings, but they do not facilitate collaboration.

At least two team members faced unavoidable work/life issues during this project that affected our work on several aspects of the project.  One was our technical expert, James. We chose a very technical project because we all hoped it would be a significant learning experience, and it received the most enthusiasm from the marker previously (and we needed better marks). This was an unfortunate decision as most of the team did not have as much technical knowledge about the specific project as we needed and could not acquire it.

As a real life IT program manager we would normally call in additional resources at times like these but that is clearly not possible here. People performed very well in their individual areas of interest. </p>
