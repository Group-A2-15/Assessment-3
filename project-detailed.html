					<h2>Detailed Plan</h2>
				</div>
				<h3>Aims and Goals</h3><br>
				<p>TThe goal of our project is to provide an additional source of communication during a state of emergency or disaster using a combination of new and existing technology. With existing lines of communication like the cell network, it relies on a central trunk exchange, regional exchanges and outer satellite stations (ie cell towers). If a cell tower is destroyed or taken offline during an emergency our project idea provides another source of communication for still images. </p>

 <p>We aim to build on new and existing technologies to deliver an easy to use, portable communication device. Starting with a Raspberry PI loaded with an Android operating system, peripherals like USB camera, audio cables, small keyboard/mouse, 30,000 mAh battery pack with 5v 2A output and a Baofeng UV-5R ham radio. By combining these devices, we can create a simple and portable version of an SSTV transmitter and receiver. Using this ham radio model, we can interchange between UH and VH frequency modulation for a possible increase of communication distance and quality.</p>

<p>Looking beyond the original scope to a future state, we would look to move away from the android OS towards a Linux distro for greater flexibility in application development. This would also enable us to add features like SSL message encryption and an outlook of multi-platform architecture.</P>

<h3>Roles</h3><br>
<p>We've selected five vital roles for this project:</p>
<p><b>Software programmer</b> – This person will need to be adept with Java, C++ & Python languages to program the android interface and any APIs or other connectors required by client systems.</p>
<p><b>Hardware specialist</b> – As it is anticipated that the product will be used in extreme conditions appropriate choice and testing of hardware is critical and multiple options should be explored. We also need to look for cheap robust production options as a key target market, emergency services and volunteer fire services, have restricted budget. Experience in industrial design prototypes and production will be important here as equipment will need to be specifically modelled for secure transport, access and use in highly specific and confined spaces, eg emergency vehicles.</P>
  <p><b>Security analyst</b> – as well as security testing of the prototype, this role will handle liaison and analysis with contacts from the key clients regarding system access, security requirements, policies and protocols for some of our key potential clients, ie emergency services, first responders.</p>
<p><b>UX/UI specialist</b> – A critical role as the system is designed to be used in high stress situations potentially by volunteer workers and ordinary citizens it will be critical to properly consider the working environment and context and ensure that the technology is sufficiently instinctive and resilient to operate and that it supports rather than interfering with other essential activities.  This role will need to investigate the end-to-end customer journey of our target audience in an operational setting. In addition to any pre-use training, they will need to ensure that the interface and operation are instinctive, and that contextual help is easily available and understandable in an emergency context.  The ease of use will be critical for deciding which customers to target. <p>
  <p><b>Project Manager</b> - Someone to maintain an overall view, track, coordinate and manage progress, budget, and liaise with critical externals (funding agents, target market governance). It is also critical to document the project to ensure transparency and robust documentation and explanations for sponsors and market.  </p>
